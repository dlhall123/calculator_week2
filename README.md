This calculator application is a simple calculator that allows a user to:
-run several calculations that require two arguments
-run several calculations that require a single argument

The text input on the application UI only allow numeric entries up to the hundredth place (.01).

The Application displays the result of the most recent calculation to the user, as well as maintains a history of
calculations performed(sorted newest -> oldest).

This calculator app also provides a memory function, similar to physical calculators, which allows a user to add/subtract from the memory, clear the memory,
and recall the memory (which displays the current amount in memory in the result field)
